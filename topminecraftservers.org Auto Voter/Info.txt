*How To Run*
1. Go to the "Compiled [Exe]" folder.
2. Open the "config.ini" file.
3. Enter your username and voting link.
4. Save changes.
5. Run the "TopMinecraftServers.org [AutoVoter].exe" executable.

*Important Info*
In case the script messes up with the timings, just install AutoHotkey and then edit the
script and make it suitable to your timings so it works perfectly. I put the timings at default
based on my Wi-Fi speed, you can change yours if you want to.

*Note*
This script is made only for automation so that you don't have to manually click through the
link and type the info. You can use this script to automatically vote everyday without you
having to open your browser and type the link and do the voting stuff.

*Is It Safe?*
Yes this script is 100% safe. You can scan the executable for yourself or go through my
source code where you can look through the different files and the script and you can compile
it yourself.
